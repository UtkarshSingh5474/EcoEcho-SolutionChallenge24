## Problem Statement
In today's world, the global community is facing urgent challenges related to climate change, environmental degradation, and unsustainable consumption patterns. Individuals often lack accessible and engaging tools to participate in meaningful sustainability actions tailored to their daily lives. Despite growing awareness of these issues, there remains a gap in easily adopting and tracking personal sustainability practices.

EcoEcho seeks to address this gap by providing a solution that empowers individuals to take impactful actions towards sustainability in a simple and rewarding way. The lack of a centralized platform for personalized sustainability tasks tailored to users' preferences and locations inhibits many from making consistent eco-friendly choices. Additionally, there is a need for a community-driven approach to encourage, share, and celebrate these efforts among peers. 

EcoEcho aims to inspire and facilitate positive environmental and social impact at the individual level. Through this approach, EcoEcho aims to contribute to the broader global goals of mitigating climate change, promoting responsible consumption, and fostering sustainable communities.

Our solution offers a user-friendly platform where users can discover and complete personalized sustainability tasks based on their location, preferences, and lifestyle.

Through EcoEcho, users receive a tailored set of tasks each day, week, and month, ranging from simple actions like using public transport to more impactful tasks such as planting trees or donating to local causes.
